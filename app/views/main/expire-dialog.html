<div>
	This version expires in <strong>January 15th</strong>, 2010.<br />
	<small>After that is recommended to remove this version of <strong>Geocaching for webOS</strong> and download new from Preware (or App Catalog if available).
	Reason for this limitation is changing application ID for release in Palm's App Catalog.
	Thank you for your understanding.</small>
